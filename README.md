### Prerequisites
Completion of [Introduction to Github](https://github.com/WilcoxAPCS/intro-to-git). Keep that page open, as steps from that `README` will be referred to

### Objective
Use this repository to store all your Java Projects

### Directions

`Instruction Set A` will ensure you have a copy of your git repository on your computer. If you have a local copy of your APCSA github repository on your computer, skip to __Instruction Set B__.

`Instruction Set B` will ensure your Eclipse workspace is set to your local copy of your APCSA Github repository. This means that any projects you create will by default be under version control, and you can follow [Uploading your changes to Github](https://github.com/WilcoxAPCS/intro-to-git#uploading-your-changes-to-github) to upload changes at the end of every class.

**Rewards** You will be able to commit and push your code to your own private repostitory on Github! Making it easy to browse and accessible from everywhere. 

Your expected workflow during class is then:
1. Arrive and load your Git repository as your Eclipse workspace
2. Commit and push all your code at end of class. 
3. ??
4. PROFIT!! (by getting experience working with version control and being able to take advantage of the snazzy Github interace when viewing your code. It will surely come in handy when you're studying!)

__Instruction Set A__

If this is your first time importing the repository (i.e. there are no Projects).
1. Follow Steps 1-5 in [Importing your Assignment into Eclipse](https://github.com/WilcoxAPCS/intro-to-git#importing-your-assignment-into-eclipse).
2. In Step 6, note the `Local Directory` you have chosen for your repository
3. After completion of Step 6, a local copy of your git repository will be created on your computer.

If this is NOT your first time importing the repository (i.e. there ARE existing projects).
Follow [Importing your Assignment into Eclipse]

__Instruction Set B__

1. Navigate to File > Switch Workspace > Other ...

2. Navigate to the location of your local git repository, this should be the `Local Directory` you entered in Step 6
